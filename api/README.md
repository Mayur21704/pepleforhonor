# People for Honor Backend API

A lightweight PHP + MySQL backend for powering Events, Join Us, and Contact forms.

## Prerequisites
- PHP 8.1+ (CLI) with PDO MySQL extension
- MySQL 8+ (or MariaDB 10.4+)
- Windows PowerShell or any terminal

## Quick Start (Local)
1) Configure database credentials via environment file (recommended)
- Create `api/.env` in this folder with:
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=peopleforhonor
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=your-local-password-or-empty
```
The file is read by `bootstrap_env.php` and used in `config/database.php`.

2) Initialize the database (creates DB + tables and seeds sample events):
```bash
# From this api/ folder
php setup.php
```

3) Start the PHP dev server (doc root is this folder):
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

4) Test the API:
- Events (public): http://localhost:8000/api/events/read.php
- Join Us (submit): http://localhost:8000/api/join/submit.php
- Contact (submit): http://localhost:8000/api/contact/submit.php
- Admin Panel (events UI): http://localhost:8000/admin/

## What setup.php does
- Creates the database `peopleforhonor`
- Creates the `events` table
- Seeds sample events if the table is empty
- Creates the `join_submissions` table (Join Us form)
- Creates the `contact_messages` table (Contact form)
- Safe to re-run any time

## Frontend Integration
- `honor-forge-webapp/src/components/UpcomingEvents.jsx`
  - Fetches from `${VITE_API_BASE_URL}/api/events/read.php`
- `honor-forge-webapp/src/pages/JoinUs.jsx`
  - Submits to `${VITE_API_BASE_URL}/api/join/submit.php`
- `honor-forge-webapp/src/components/Contact.jsx`
  - Submits to `${VITE_API_BASE_URL}/api/contact/submit.php`

For production, set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in the frontend and configure `api/.env` (or real env vars) on the server.
